# CaterBot
This repository documents the redesign, structural validation, and simulation of a caterpillar-tracked agricultural robot, CATERBOT. The project successfully converted a transport-only platform into a multi-functional machine capable of soil cultivation. The final result is a validated CAD model and a functional Unity 3D simulation demonstrating its field performance.⚙️ Engineering & Design Highlights1. Modular Platform RedesignThe original Caterbot was modified to embrace modularity:Container Removal: The original cargo container was removed to reduce the center of gravity and enable rear attachment mounting.Universal Mounting Interface: A Modular Mounting Plate was designed and integrated into the aluminum chassis. This plate provides standardized, quick-change attachment points for various future agricultural implements.2. Cultivator Attachment DesignA fixed-depth, rigid-tine cultivator was designed as the primary implement.FeatureDetailPurposeTypeFixed-Depth CultivatorEnsures consistent tillage depth for specific crop requirements without relying on actuators.Frame MaterialStructural Steel (Conceptual)Chosen for high Yield Strength to withstand significant drag and pulling forces.Structural ReinforcementHeavy Cross & Diagonal TubingAdded to drastically increase the static stiffness and torsional rigidity of the cultivator frame, preventing yielding under max load.Working Width$[\sim 0.65 \text{ meters}]$Optimized to till the soil between the robot's tracks.3. Structural Validation (ANSYS)The primary goal was to ensure the modified chassis could handle the new, high-stress load case (tilling).Original Chassis Validation: The base chassis was previously validated in ANSYS to safely handle a static payload of $80\text{ kg}$ (Max Deformation: $[1.378\text{ mm}]$; Max Stress: $[11.54\text{ MPa}]$).Cultivation Load Case: The current design will be simulated against the calculated Drawbar Pull Force required to drag the cultivator through $[\text{Soil Type/Texture}]$. The simulation confirms the added structural reinforcement keeps stresses well below the material's yield strength.🎬 Unity 3D SimulationThe Unity 3D simulation showcases the CATERBOT's core functionality, merging the CAD model with physics-based environmental interaction.1. Simulation PlatformEngine: Unity 3DIntegration: ROS2 (Conceptual for future control/path planning)2. Simulation Video DemonstrationThe demonstration video shows the CATERBOT executing an autonomous path while the cultivator effectively interacts with the virtual terrain, simulating soil tilling operations.[EMBED YOUR YOUTUBE/VIDEO LINK HERE]Markdown<p align="center">
